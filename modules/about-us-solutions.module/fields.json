Yet, as StarRocks adoption has grown, so too have the analytics needs of enterprises. The challenges enterprises face in the analytics space are vast, complex, and require a level of dedicated support that an open project couldn't support on its own.</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">That's why we started CelerData, to bring more resources to the StarRocks project while helping businesses everywhere accelerate their analytics performance with the support and flexibility they need to stay focused on serving their customers and not managing their analytics solutions.</div>"
